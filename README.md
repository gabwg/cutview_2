# Simple Bible App


Initial goal was to build a reimplementation of the Chinese bible app seagospel.CUTView app in Jetpack Compose, an app that is no longer being maintained and no longer exists on the Google Play Store. The original app became unusable when it broke in Android 13.
Assets such as the Bible translation (stored as an XML) were copied from the original app.

After implementing the basic functionality of the app to display the Chinese translation, I have decided to expand upon this and build more translations such as English into the app to further enhance versatility.

The english translation  (NIV, ESV)  XML files are from https://github.com/Beblia/Holy-Bible-XML-Format
